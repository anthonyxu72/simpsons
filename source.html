		<p>To get the visualization running locally on your computer,<br />
			the first thing you need to do is follow this 
			<a href="https://github.com/anthonyxu72/simpsons">link</a>.<br />
			This should take you to the github repository that houses all of our source code.<br />
			To obtain all of it at once, simply hit "Download Zip" on the right side of the page.<br />
			Once this is done, you can extract all of the files onto your computer. From here,<br />
			opening the "simpson.html" file onto the browser of your choice should run the visualization.<br />
			And there you have it! The visualization is now running locally.
