	<body>
		<p>The data for this visualization was gathered from 
		<a href="http://simpsons.wikia.com/">http://simpsons.wikia.com/</a> . The API was 
		used to download information on the characters, locations, and episodes of the 
		entire series of the Simpsons show. This data was then formatted into JSON objects 
		in order to be used to create the visualizations.
		</p>
		
		<p>There was a large amount of data to be handled. Given the nature of wikis, 
		there were a lot of inconsistencies with the data and the formatting. This may 
		have caused some missing or unclean data in the dataset, but many of the issues 
		should have been addressed.
